# Rocket_Design_Class_Project
The project is to design and "fly" sounding rockets. Part I is the design phase using Design Input Parameters that reflects constraints on i) trajectory theory or propulsion system, ii) Strength of structural materials and iii) flight stability (aerodynamics). Part II is the "flying" phase, using the rocket simulator (OpenRocket).
